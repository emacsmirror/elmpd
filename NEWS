* 0.1.7 build

** User-visible changes

*** Byte-compiled functions are handled better when logging

*** All keyword arguments to `elmpd-connect' are validated

An error will be signalled if any are un-recognized.
* 0.1.6 build

** User-visible changes

The `elmpd' logging facility now takes a facility field; the idea is that packages built on top of `elmpd' can re-use its logging feature while still distinguishing their log statements.

* 0.1.5 build

** User-visible changes

Callers can explicitly rule-out local sockets by setting `elmpd-socket' to nil before calling `elmpd-connect'.

* 0.1.4 build

** User-visible changes

*** Support for local Unix sockets

* 0.1.3 build

** User-visible changes

*** Signature change for idle callbacks

This commit changes the signature for idle callbacks; instead of receiving the response text ("changed: foo\nchanged: bar\n...") as its second parameter, it will now receive a list of symbols indicating the changed sub-system(s) (e.g. '(foo bar)).

* 0.1.2 build

** Bug fixes

*** No longer use regex to find successful responses

For reasons unknown, the author obtusely chose to use an
overly-complex regex to detect successful responses. This commit fixes
that regrettable choice.

* 0.1.1 build

** User-visible changes

*** Added =elmpd-clear-log=

*** =elmpd-connection= objects being pretty-printed in log messages

** Bug fixes

*** "noidle" response not being processed

Fixed a nasty bug wherein the "OK\n" response from "noidle" commands wasn't being processed correctly

* 0.1.0 release

Initial release.
