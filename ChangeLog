	Add two new functions: `elmpd-conn-status' and `elmpd-conn-failed-p'.
	This patch adds two new utility functions for checking the status
	of an elmpd connection. In addition it tidies up several docstrings,
	and adds some utility scripts (under 'admin') for validating
	commits.

2021-09-03  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Minor commit: indentation issues, moved a few defuns so they would be defined before use.

2020-12-25  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Added 'elmpd-chain'.

2020-12-13  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	BUGFIX: 'elmpd-send' was trying to send "noidle" in the old way (rather than creating an elmpd-command instance).

2020-12-10  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Added support for command lists.
	'elmpd-send' callers can now give a list of strings to indicate
	that they'd like these commands to be sent as a command list.
	They can also optionally specify a callback "style" governing
	how their callback will be invoked with the results of the
	command list (one big block of text, a list of results, or
	one response at a time, as they are received).

2020-11-06  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Bugfix: Handle no current command in failure messages.

2020-10-19  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Minor updates exclusively to documentation.
	This will hopefully be the last 0.1 commit.

2020-10-01  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Assorted improvements.
	This commit is work-in-progress while developing other code on
	top of the 'elmpd' library:

	    1. Improve the way in which 'elmpd--pp-conn' handles byte-
	       compiled functions
	    2. Check all keyword arguments to 'elmpd-connect' & error
	       on any that are unrecognzied

2020-09-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Add facility to elmpd logging.
	This commit adds a "facility" field to 'elmpd-log'; this will
	allow packages built on top of `elmpd' to distinguish their
	log statements.

2020-09-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Provide for explicitly selecting TCP connections.
	This commit does two things:

	    1. allows callers to explicitly rule out local connections
	       by setting 'elmpd-socket' to nil when calling
	       'elmpd-connect'
	    2. also, call 'sit-for' in tests involvoing a mocked server;
	       empirically this avoids deleting the server before all
	       input is processed

2020-09-27  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Add support for local connections.
	This commit adds a new keyword to `elmpd-connect': :local. If
	given, it shall be the path to a Unix socket on which MPD is
	listening.

	Resolve #3.
	This commit changes the signature for idle callbacks; instead of
	receiving the response text ("changed: foo\nchanged: bar\n...")
	as its second parameter, it will now receive a list of symbols
	indicating the changed sub-system(s) (e.g. '(foo bar)).

2020-09-26  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Resolve #2.
	This commit changes `elfeed-connection--filter` to no longer
	use a regex to detect a complete, succesful response, but rather
	to simply examine the last three characters of the current buffer.
	This results in orders-of-magnitude improvement in performance on
	requests that produce a lot of data.

2020-09-20  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Added MELPA badges.

2020-09-20  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	This commit does the following:
	    1. adds pretty printing of `elmpd-connection' instances

	    2. adds the function `elmpd-clear-log'

	    3. fixed a nasty bug wherein the "OK\n" response from "noidle"
	       commands wasn't being processed correctly

	    4. started a unit test suite

	    5. corrects several spelling errors caught in review by riscy

2020-08-08  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Initial commit.
