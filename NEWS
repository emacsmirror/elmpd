elmpd News -- history of user-visible changes           -*- outline -*-

* 0.1.3 build:

** User-visible changes

*** Signature change for idle callbacks

This commit changes the signature for idle callbacks; instead of receiving the response text ("changed: foo\nchanged: bar\n...") as its second parameter, it will now receive a list of symbols indicating the changed sub-system(s) (e.g. '(foo bar)).

* 0.1.2 build:

** Bug fixes

*** No longer use regex to find successful responses

For reasons unknown, the author obtusely chose to use an
overly-complex regex to detect successful responses. This commit fixes
that regrettable choice.

* 0.1.1 build:

** User-visible changes

*** Added =elmpd-clear-log=

*** =elmpd-connection= objects being pretty-printed in log messages

** Bug fixes

*** "noidle" response not being processed

Fixed a nasty bug wherein the "OK\n" response from "noidle" commands wasn't being processed correctly

* 0.1.0 release:

Initial release.
