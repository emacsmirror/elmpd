;;; Commentary:

;; These are the unit tests for `elmpd' command-list support.  The
;; primary unit test suite is in test-elmpd.el.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'elmpd)

;; This is touchy: generally, when our client issues a command, it
;; will be a single line, and the client will not do anything else
;; until we have processed that command & written the response to the
;; socket.

;; There are a few cases where that does not hold:

;; 1. the "idle" command: the client expects no response, and may
;; follow up with a "noidle" quickly enough that it appears in the
;; same message to us. I.e. `text' could look like "idle foo bar
;; splat\nnoidle\n" (Nb. the client will never send anything more than
;; that, since it expects an OK in response to the noidle command).

;; 2. command lists: the client may (and `elmpd' in fact does)
;; choose to write the command list one line at a time; that is,
;; instead of doing something equivalent to:
;;
;;   (process-send-string fd "command_list_begin\nfoo\n\bar\ncommand_list_end\n") (*)
;;
;; they instead do something like:
;;
;;   (process-send-string fd "command_list_begin\n")
;;   (process-send-string fd "foo\n")
;;   (process-send-string fd "\bar\n")
;;   (process-send-string fd "command_list_end\n"
;;
;; While less likely, they *could* do this with *any* command: e.g.
;;
;;   (process-send-string fd "consume ")
;;   (process-send-string fd "1\n")
;;
;; is idiosyncratic, but legitimate.
;;
;; 3. This is unlikely, but depending on the underlying transport and
;; its configuration, if the client issues a lengthy command list, it
;; may show up here in pieces; e.g. even if the client sent the
;; command above as in (*), `text' could be something like
;; "command_list_begin\nfoo\ba", followed by "r\nspla" and finally
;; "t\nend_command_list\n".
;;
;; This is true of *any* command if it's long enough relative to the
;; underlying transport-- I could probably construct a socket with a
;; sufficiently pathological configuration that "idle player
;; stored_playlist options mixer sticker\n" would be broken up into
;; multiple messages.

;; Case 1 requires additional logic when we're expecting an "idle"
;; command. Cases 2 & 3 are the same in that so long as the response
;; received so far is a prefix of the expected response, we can
;; continue to accumulate text in the hope that we'll eventually
;; receive evrything we're looking for.

;; This process auto-terminates: its plist comes equipped with a list
;; of messages (property :msgs)-- each time it consumes one and writes
;; the response, it will check to see if there are any left. If not,
;; it deletes itself.

  "Run BODY against a mocked MPD server expecting CONVO from test NAME.

The body can test against a mocked MPD connection named `conn',
which will be automatically cleaned-up on exit (clean or not).

CONVO is a list of request/response pairs describing the
conversation expected to take place.  In general, each list item
will be a cons cell whose car is the exact text the client is
expected to send & whose cdr is the exact text with which the
server should respond.  Note that this should be the text as
exressed on the wire: e.g. (\"ping\n\" . \"OK\n\").

When the client is expected to send the \"idle\" command, receive
no response, then send the \"noidle\" command, this can be
expressed as (idle \"system1\" \"system2\" ...).  If the caller
wants to simulate the \"idle\" message getting a response, that
can be expressed as per usual, e.g:

    (\"idle\n\" . \"changes: player\nOK\n\")

IDLE-SPEC gives the idle specification with which the connection
shall be created.  If 'nil' is given, the connection will not
\(of its own volition) issue the idle command.  If given, it
should be in the form accepted by `elmpd-connect'."
