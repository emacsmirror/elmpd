	Resolve #3.
	This commit changes the signature for idle callbacks; instead of
	receiving the response text ("changed: foo\nchanged: bar\n...")
	as its second parameter, it will now receive a list of symbols
	indicating the changed sub-system(s) (e.g. '(foo bar)).

	Resolve #2.
	This commit changes `elfeed-connection--filter` to no longer
	use a regex to detect a complete, succesful response, but rather
	to simply examine the last three characters of the current buffer.
	This results in orders-of-magnitude improvement in performance on
	requests that produce a lot of data.
