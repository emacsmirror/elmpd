	Add facility to elmpd logging.
	This commit adds a "facility" field to 'elmpd-log'; this will
	allow packages built on top of `elmpd' to distinguish their
	log statements.

	Provide for explicitly selecting TCP connections.
	This commit does two things:

	    1. allows callers to explicitly rule out local connections
	       by setting 'elmpd-socket' to nil when calling
	       'elmpd-connect'
	    2. also, call 'sit-for' in tests involvoing a mocked server;
	       empirically this avoids deleting the server before all
	       input is processed

	Add support for local connections.
	This commit adds a new keyword to `elmpd-connect': :local. If
	given, it shall be the path to a Unix socket on which MPD is
	listening.

	Resolve #3.
	This commit changes the signature for idle callbacks; instead of
	receiving the response text ("changed: foo\nchanged: bar\n...")
	as its second parameter, it will now receive a list of symbols
	indicating the changed sub-system(s) (e.g. '(foo bar)).

	Resolve #2.
	This commit changes `elfeed-connection--filter` to no longer
	use a regex to detect a complete, succesful response, but rather
	to simply examine the last three characters of the current buffer.
	This results in orders-of-magnitude improvement in performance on
	requests that produce a lot of data.

	Added MELPA badges.

	This commit does the following:
	    1. adds pretty printing of `elmpd-connection' instances

	    2. adds the function `elmpd-clear-log'

	    3. fixed a nasty bug wherein the "OK\n" response from "noidle"
	       commands wasn't being processed correctly

	    4. started a unit test suite

	    5. corrects several spelling errors caught in review by riscy
